# Automatic-Parkrun-League-Table-Generator
Dedicated to UEA Triathlon Club.

I will complete the README when I can be bothered. Basically, the idea of Parkrun League is that points are awarded for attending Parkruns, and PB-ing. At UEA Triathlon Club, we run Parkrun League at Spring. Traditionally, the Secretary of the club use a spreadsheet to keep track of everyone's score. This program automates the process that was manually done by the Secretary.

To get the league table, run ``test_wrapper.py``

## TODO
 - A more thorough README
 - Database slicing, so I get to process a subset of the database
 - Individual athlete performance analysis
 - Output to Excel spreadsheet, rather than CSV
 - Output to HTML
